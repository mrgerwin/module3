When doing a push request, github's quick setup page says that I should push to https://github.com/mrgerwin/module3.git instead of just the directory https://github.com/mrgerwin/module3  does it matter which one I use?

I did get the error   

$ git push -u origin master
error: src refspec master does not match any.
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/mrgerwin/module3.git'

Question 2
It looks like atom has some built in github functions.  I was able to use the package menu in atom to open a repository and push my questions.md.  Would students have this ability or is it just because I am the owner of the repo?

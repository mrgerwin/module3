When doing a push request, github's quick setup page says that I should push to https://github.com/mrgerwin/module3.git instead of just the directory https://github.com/mrgerwin/module3  does it matter which one I use?

I did get the error   

$ git push -u origin master
error: src refspec master does not match any.
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/mrgerwin/module3.git'
